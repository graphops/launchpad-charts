## Introduction

The [Graph Network Indexer](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer) components are required for participating in [The Graph's Decentralised Network](https://thegraph.com/explorer). `indexer-agent` performs interactions with the Graph Protocol contracts on-chain, and `indexer-service` intermediates requests and ensures query payment is valid.

## Chart Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) [and contributors](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-charts/graphs/contributors)
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `ServiceMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))

## Quickstart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add graphops http://graphops.github.io/launchpad-charts
$ helm install my-release graphops/graph-toolbox
```

## Upgrading

We recommend that you pin the version of the Chart that you deploy. You can use the `--version` flag with `helm install` and `helm upgrade` to specify a chart version constraint.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Changes to the version of the application (the `appVersion`) that the Chart deploys will generally result in a patch version bump for the Chart. Breaking changes to the Chart or its `values.yaml` interface will be reflected with a major version bump.

We do not recommend that you upgrade the application by overriding `image.tag`. Instead, use the version of the Chart that is built for your desired `appVersion`.
