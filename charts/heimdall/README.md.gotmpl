## Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) and contributors
- Deploys a scalable pool of `statefulset` instances, with auto-scaling support
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `PodMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards for polygon ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))

## Quickstart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add graphops http://graphops.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install my-release graphops/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
```

Once the release is installed, heimdall will begin syncing from snapshot if the following was specified:
```fromSnapshot:
    # -- Enable initialising Heimdall from a remote Snapshot
    enabled: true
    # -- URL to snapshot to download and extract, see [here](https://snapshots.matic.today)
    snapshotUrl:
```
You can use `kubectl logs` to monitor the download status. See the Values section to install Prometheus `PodMonitor`s and a Grafana dashboard.
