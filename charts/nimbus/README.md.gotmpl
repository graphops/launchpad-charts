## Chart Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) and contributors
- Deploys a scalable pool of `rpcdaemon` instances, with auto-scaling support, for automatic elastic JSON-RPC
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `ServiceMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))
- Support for exposing a NodePort to enable inbound P2P dials for better peering

## Quickstart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add graphops http://graphops.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install my-release graphops/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
```

## Specifying the Engine API JWT

To drive block progression of an Execution Client, you will need to configure a JWT that is used by Nimbus to authenticate with the Execution Client's Engine API on port `8551`. You will need to pass the same JWT to your Execution Client.

You can specify the JWT for Nimbus either as a literal value, or as a reference to a key in an existing Kubernetes Secret. If you specify a literal value, it will be wrapped into a new Kubernetes Secret and passed into the Nimbus Pod.

Using a literal value:

```yaml
# values.yaml

nimbus:
  jwt:
    fromLiteral: some-secure-random-value-that-you-generate # You can generate this with: openssl rand -hex 32
```

Using an existing Kubernetes Secret:

```yaml
# values.yaml

nimbus:
  jwt:
    existingSecret:
      name: my-ethereum-mainnet-jwt-secret
      key: jwt
```

## Enabling inbound P2P dials

By default, your Nimbus node will not have an internet-accessible port for P2P traffic. This makes it harder for your node to establish a strong set of peers because you cannot accept inbound P2P dials. To change this behaviour, you can set `nimbus.p2pNodePort.enabled` to `true`. This will make your node accessible via the Internet using a `Service` of type `NodePort`. When using `nimbus.p2pNodePort.enabled`, the exposed IP address on your Nimbus ENR record will be the "External IP" of the Node where the Pod is running. When using this mode, `nimbus.replicaCount` will be locked to `1`.

```yaml
# values.yaml

nimbus:
  p2pNodePort:
    enabled: true
    port: 31000 # Must be globally unique and available on the host
```
