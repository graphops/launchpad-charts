## Chart Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) and contributors
- Deploys a scalable pool of `rpcdaemon` instances, with auto-scaling support, for automatic elastic JSON-RPC
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `ServiceMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))
- Support for exposing a NodePort to enable inbound P2P dials for better peering

## Quickstart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add graphops http://graphops.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install my-release graphops/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
```

## Specifying the Engine API JWT

To use Erigon on a network that requires a Consensus Client, you will need to configure a JWT that is used by the Consensus Client to authenticate with the Engine API on port `8551`. You will need to pass the same JWT to your Consensus Client.

You can specify the JWT for Erigon either as a literal value, or as a reference to a key in an existing Kubernetes Secret. If you specify a literal value, it will be wrapped into a new Kubernetes Secret and passed into the Erigon Pod.

Using a literal value:

```yaml
# values.yaml

statefulNode:
  jwt:
    fromLiteral: some-secure-random-value-that-you-generate # You can generate this with: openssl rand -hex 32
```

Using an existing Kubernetes Secret:

```yaml
# values.yaml

statefulNode:
  jwt:
    existingSecret:
      name: my-ethereum-mainnet-jwt-secret
      key: jwt
```

## JSON-RPC

### Built-in JSON-RPC

You can access JSON-RPC via the stateful node `Service` (`<release-name>-erigon-stateful-node`) on port `8545` by default.

Synchronous request performance is typically best when using the built-in JSON-RPC server, however for large throughput workloads you should use a scalable set of `rpcdaemon`s.

### Scalable `Deployment` of `rpcdaemon`s

For workloads where synchronous performance is less important than the scalability of request throughput, you should use a scalable `Deployment` of `rpcdaemon`s. In this mode, the number of `rpcdaemon`s can be scaled up. Each one connects to the stateful node process via its gRPC API. You can also use node selectors and other placement configuration to customise where `rpcdaemon`s are deployed within your cluster.

A dedicated `Service` (`<release-name>-erigon-rpcdaemon`) will be created to load balance JSON-RPC requests across `rpcdaemon` `Pod`s in the scalable `Deployment`. See the Values section to configure the `Deployment` and the number of replicas.

#### JSON-RPC Autoscaling

You can enable autoscaling for your scalable `Deployment` of `rpcdaemon`s. When enabled, the Chart will install a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` into the cluster, which will manage the number of `rpcdaemon` replicas based on resource utilization.

If doing this, be sure to configure `rpcdaemon.resources.requests` with appropriate values, as the CPU and Memory utilization targets set in the autoscaling config are relative to the requested resource values.

## Enabling inbound P2P dials

By default, your Erigon node will not have an internet-accessible port for P2P traffic. This makes it harder for your node to establish a strong set of peers because you cannot accept inbound P2P dials. To change this behaviour, you can set `statefulNode.p2pNodePort.enabled` to `true`. This will make your node accessible via the Internet using a `Service` of type `NodePort`. When using `statefulNode.p2pNodePort.enabled`, the exposed IP address on your Erigon ENR record will be the "External IP" of the Node where the Pod is running. When using this mode, `statefulNode.replicaCount` will be locked to `1`.

```yaml
# values.yaml

statefulNode:
  p2pNodePort:
    enabled: true
    port: 31000 # Must be globally unique and available on the host
```
