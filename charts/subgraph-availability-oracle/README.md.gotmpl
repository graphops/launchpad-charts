## Introduction

[Subgraph Radio](https://docs.graphops.xyz/graphcast/radios/subgraph-radio) is a Graphcast Radio focused on Subgraphs.

## Chart Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) [and contributors](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-charts/graphs/contributors)
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `ServiceMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))

## Enabling inbound P2P dials

By default, your subgraph-radio release will not have an internet-accessible port for P2P traffic. This makes it harder for your node to establish a strong set of peers because you cannot accept inbound P2P dials. To change this behaviour, you can set `p2pNodePort.enabled` to `true`. This will make your node accessible via the Internet using a `Service` of type `NodePort`. When using `p2pNodePort.enabled`, the exposed IP address on your arbitrum ENR record will be the "External IP" of the Node where the Pod is running. When using this mode, `replicaCount` will be locked to `1`.

```yaml
# values.yaml

p2pNodePort:
  enabled: true
  port: 31000 # Must be globally unique and available on the host
```

## Quickstart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add graphops http://graphops.github.io/launchpad-charts
$ helm install my-release graphops/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
```
