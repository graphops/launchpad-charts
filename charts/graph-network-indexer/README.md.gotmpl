## Introduction

The [Graph Network Indexer](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer) components are required for participating in [The Graph's Decentralised Network](https://thegraph.com/explorer). `indexer-agent` performs interactions with the Graph Protocol contracts on-chain, and `indexer-service` intermediates requests and ensures query payment is valid.

## Chart Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) [and contributors](https://github.com/graphops/helm-charts/graphs/contributors)
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `ServiceMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))
