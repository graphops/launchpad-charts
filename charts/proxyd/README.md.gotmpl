## Introduction

[Proxyd](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/proxyd) is an EVM-blockchain JSON-RPC router and load balancer developed in Go by [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). It is capable of load balancing, automatic failover, intelligent request routing and very basic caching.

## Chart Features

- Actively maintained by [GraphOps](https://graphops.xyz) and contributors
- Strong security defaults (non-root execution, ready-only root filesystem, drops all capabilities)
- Readiness checks to ensure traffic only hits `Pod`s that are healthy and ready to serve requests
- Support for `ServiceMonitor`s to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator))
- Support for configuring Grafana dashboards ([grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana))
- Preconfigured RPC method mappings for pruned, archive and archive trace nodes

## Quickstart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add graphops http://graphops.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install my-release graphops/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
```

The load balanced JSON-RPC endpoint is available at `<release-name>-proxyd:8545` by default.

## Configuring {{ template "chart.name" . }}

### JSON-RPC Backends and Backend Groups

Backends are the blockchain nodes that will sit behind proxyd and answer requests. When defining a backend, you will need to provide a URL, and assign it to a set of backend groups.

The Chart configures 3 backend groups by default:
- `pruned` - nodes that have pruned state
- `archive` - nodes that have full archival state, but may not have trace data
- `archive-trace` - nodes that have full archival state including trace data

You should assign your backends to the groups that make sense.

Example:

```yaml
backends:
  erigon-pruned-0:
    enabled: true
    rpcUrl: http://eth-mainnet-pruned-0-erigon-rpcdaemons.ethereum:8545
    groups:
      - pruned
  erigon-pruned-1:
    enabled: true
    rpcUrl: http://eth-mainnet-pruned-1-erigon-rpcdaemons.ethereum:8545
    groups:
      - pruned
  erigon-archive-trace-0:
    enabled: true
    rpcUrl: http://eth-mainnet-archive-trace-0-erigon-rpcdaemons.ethereum:8545
    groups:
      - pruned
      - archive
      - archive-trace
  external-with-basic-auth:
    enabled: true
    rpcUrl: http://some-externa-service-that-requires-http-basic-auth
    extraConfig:
      username: your_username
      password: your_password
    groups:
      - pruned
      - archive
```

You can use your own backend groups by customising the RPC Method Mappings.

### JSON-RPC Method Mappings

RPC Method Mappings (see [Values](#Values)) are used to:

- Define which JSON-RPC methods are allowed (anything not on the list will be rejected)
- Define which backend group should be used to handle each method

These mappings are pre-configured for the default backend groups, but you can change them if you want to use different groups or customise the routing behaviour.

### Computed Template Variables

The following additional template variables are computed and injected into the template context under the `computed` key:

- `backendGroups` - a `dict` of `group_name -> [backend1_name, backend2_name, backend3_name]`

You can use these keys in your custom configuration template (e.g. `{{`{{ .computed.computedValue }}`}}`).
